DISCLAIMER: This project is still in development and hasn't produced a stable version yet.

## PolySloth

`PolySloth` is supposed to simplify the acquisiton of vocabulary for aspiring polyglot and even normal language learners. 
Collecting and converting new words to flash cards is a tedious process. Therefore `PolySloth` aims to automatize big parts of a workflow to add new words to flashcards and minimize the need for human supervision.

### General information

The project is written in Python and involves the following third party applications / resources:

* [`Todoist`](https://todoist.com/) (todo list manager)
* [`Anki`](https://apps.ankiweb.net/) (flash cards)
* [`PONS`](pons.com) (online dictionary)

To see what future features are planned to be included in this project, check `TODO.md`.

### Project description

The project suggests the following workflow to add new words to your flashcards:

1. Add new words to a dedicated `Todoist` project.
2. Run a Python script involving `Polysloth`.
3. Take a look at the generated file to correct possible mistakes or look up words that couldn't be found in the dictionary.
4. Import the file with `Anki`.
5. ???
6. Profit!
